                <dt class="i3">How many employees are in the National Park Service?</dt>

                <dt class="i4">How old is the National Park System?</dt>
                <dd class="i4 invisible">The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow
                    Wilson
                    on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an act signed by President Ulysses
                    S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park.

                <dt class="i5">What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
                <dd class="i5 invisible">The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by
                    the
                    Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired
                    by key attributes of the National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing
                    vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values, and
                    the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological values.

                    the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas

                <dt class="i9">How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
                <dd class="i9 invisible">Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain
                    park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have
                    passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a
                    specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as
                    well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the
                    national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes).
