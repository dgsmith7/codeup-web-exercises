                    vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values, and

                    park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have
                    passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a
                    specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as
                    well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the
                    national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes).
